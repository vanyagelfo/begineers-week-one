I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
    internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
    Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...
</p>
        HTML is cool
CSS is cooler
        JS is the best
<p>
  What do you need to create a website?</body>
</p>
  <body>Not much!
A computer (always a good start)
A text editor (I am using atom)
A web browser (I am using chrome)
Some HTML, CSS and JS files
